Steps to do style audit: 

1. Install checkstyle program (jar file) from say https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.puppycrawl.tools%20AND%20a:checkstyle

2. Run checks against your java program. Example: 
  
java -jar ~/Downloads/checkstyle*jar -c /google_checks.xml algo.java

3. FIX every issue identified as a WARN. Understand the issue by learning about
   the type of the issue mentioned in the bracket in the end. For example
[OuterTypeFileName]. You can search Google 'checkstyle OuterTypeFileName'. 

It will take you to say https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/apidocs/com/puppycrawl/tools/checkstyle/checks/OuterTypeFilenameCheck.html

Which explains the key issue as : 
"Checks that the outer type name and the file name match. For example, the
class Foo must be in a file named Foo.java."

You have named the file as algo but the program contains the class name which
is different. As the issue explains the filename shall match that of the class
name in the file. 

4. Keep rerunning until all warnings are fixed.
